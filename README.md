# Journey from Perceptron to ChatGPT: A Haiku Adventure

This repository contains the complete curriculum for learning neural network architectures, from the humble perceptron to modern transformers like ChatGPT, all through the lens of haiku poetry.

## Repository Structure

Each module has its own directory with the following components:

```
module_X/
├── README.md          # Module guide with theory, objectives, and instructions
├── code/              # Example implementations and demonstrations
├── exercises/         # Hands-on coding tasks with starter code
├── data/              # Datasets used in the module (if applicable)
└── resources/         # Additional reading materials, papers, etc.
```
